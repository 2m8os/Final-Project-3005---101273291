# Final-Project-3005---101273291
Project was done in Intellij

Language: Java

YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/6gCnQxlZ_Pg

SQL has the dml and ddl files

Documentation has the ER diagram and the Design Schema (Final Project Report)

Code contains the source files: Main.java contains the source code for the project, pom.xml contains the maven dependencies, I recommend
compiling and launching the project in Intellij

Before compiling, replace the url, user and password variables in main() of Main.java with your own.

Sorry the video was rushed, I had some difficulty trying to make it
